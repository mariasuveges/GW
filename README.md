# GW

Exercises from Wikle, Zammit-Mangion &amp; Cressie adapted to Gaia data. The data was downloaded from Gaia EDR3 using the query from Luri et al., 2021, not uploaded here because of size limitations.

#### Files:

*smc1.Rmd, smc1.html*: R Markdown and the resulting html file for data subsampling, cleaning and transformation for an exploratory data analysis. The produced subsample is contained in results_smc1/smc_small.RObj, an .RData file.

*smc2.Rmd, smc2.html*: Exploratory data analysis of the subsample produced in smc1.Rmd. The goal is visualisation before the spatial model construction for the vectorial proper motion fields of different star populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud.
